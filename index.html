					<p class="welcome">
						My career journey has been marked by successful collaborations within cross-functional teams, where I played a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of cutting-edge technologies.
						In my latest role, I am currently serving as a Full Stack Web Developer, concentrating on the back-end, for an Enterprise scanning solution tailored for Single Family REITs. This project involves extensive utilization of NodeJS, where I have showcased my proficiency in enhancing functionality and performance using it. My responsibilities extend to the development, maintenance, and testing of the back-end and infrastructure in AWS. I have played a key role in crafting APIs, creating various dashboards using ReactJS, and developing internal tools to optimize the scanning solution.
						Prior to this, I contributed to the development and maintenance of the Unified Communication client software written in C++ along with the back-end proxy server and spearheaded the development of its test automation written in C#. My diverse experiences also include working on JavaFX desktop and Android client applications, where I integrated real-time car tracking functionalities within an IoT project.
						Having gained comprehensive insights into the entire application development lifecycle, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions. My expertise extends to both client and server aspects, and I have a proven track record of implementing IoT concepts.
						I am enthusiastic about leveraging my NodeJS expertise and collaborative skills to contribute effectively to innovative projects and drive success in the dynamic field of web development.
