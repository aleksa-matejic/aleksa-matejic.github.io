					<p class="welcome">
						Throughout my career, I collaborated with cross-functional teams on projects that included the maintenance and development of VoIP and Instant Messaging & Presence technologies. My expertise extends to both client and server aspects, as well as the implementation of IoT concepts and the creation of enterprise scanning solutions tailored for Single Family REITs.
						My professional journey started at Endava, where I took charge of developing a test automation framework in C#, conducted occasional manual testing, and contributed to the development of Unified Communication client software in C++. As a member of the sustaining team, I gained comprehensive insights into the entire application development lifecycle. Subsequently, I transitioned to working on Java FX desktop and Android client applications, integrating real-time car tracking functionalities within an IoT project.
						Presently, I hold the position of a Full Stack Web Developer, focused on the back-end, of an Enterprise scanning solution for Single Family REITs. My responsibilities include extensive work with JavaScript to enhance the functionality and performance of the solution. Contributing to the development, maintenance, and testing of the backend and infrastructure in AWS. Developing API, various dashboards, and internal tools for the scanning solution.
